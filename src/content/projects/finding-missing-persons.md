## Overview
A critical tool for public safety, this system indexes and matches faces against databases of missing persons. It is designed to work with surveillance feed snapshots or public submissions to rapidly identify matches.

## Key Features
- **High Accuracy Matching**: Uses state-of-the-art face embeddings for reliable identification even with aging or partial occlusion.
- **Geo-Tagging**: Maps where partial or positive matches have been sighted.
- **Privacy First**: Designed with strict access controls and data retention policies.
- **Rapid Alerting**: Instantly notifies authorities upon a high-confidence match.

## Technical Specifications
- **Face Engine**: Utilizes FaceNet or ArcFace implementations for robust embedding generation.
- **Database**: High-performance vector database for similarity search across millions of records.
- **Cloud Native**: Deployed on scalable cloud infrastructure to handle data surges.
